Since he attended his first Loolapalooza festival in 92 he swore fidelity to independent music.

Since then he has incessantly worked as a musician, producer, sound engineer in studio and live settings.

In his 20 years of profession, he's worked with bands from all over Spain and received several awards for his albums.

Hopelessly addicted to TV series and passionate about the 'Sandwich Mixto', the spanish cheese & ham sandwich, his work is recognized by its dynamics, power and its riveting attention to detail.
